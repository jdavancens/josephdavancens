            <h1>Bio</h1>
            <p>Joseph Davancens is a composer, bassist and producer based in Santa Cruz, California. His musical thought explores the tension between hard-edged algorithmic abstraction and fluidic gesture. Always interested in broadening his palette of instrumental
                textures, his work has increasingly focused on continuous parameter spaces and their relationship to traditional modes of sound production. His works have been performed by the Borromeo String Quartet, Ensemble Pamplemousse and the Gnarwhallaby
                Quartet.</p>
            <p>In addition to his activities as a composer, Davancens has performed internationally with the band Tycho on bass guitar and keyboards. He has produced three albums with the band Doombird, a collaborative project between Davancens and songwriter
                Kris Anaya. In the early 2000s, Davancens attended Manhattan School of Music, where he earned a bachelorâ€™s degree in jazz performance. He is currently working towards a doctorate in composition from the University of California, Santa
                Cruz, where he studies with Ben Leeds Carson, Larry Polansky and Paul Nauert.</p>
